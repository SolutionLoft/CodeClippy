# PyClippy

Our mission is to make it easy for developers to write high quality code. CodeClippy is an Atom plugin that aims to act as a gateway for enabling this vision.

Initially, CodeClippy will provide access to SolutionLoft's querying engine of indexed StackOverflow questions and answers, allowing the user to interact with StackOverflow Q/A without leaving the comfort of his or her editor.
