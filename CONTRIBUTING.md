# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to PyClippy! We're actively developing this plugin, and would love your contributions and advice as we go along. Because we expect to be moving at a quick pace, please email tadas [at] solutionloft.com if you want to get involved in building features or contributing substantial pieces of code so we can discuss a plan of action for getting you in our development flow.

After we've released a beta version of the plugin, we'll take more time to formalize a code of conduct, style guidelines, and the like without needing the overhead of an email-based discussion.

If you have design advice, feature requests (keeping scope within reason), small bugs/bugfixes, or other comments to contribute, feel free to raise Issues!
